CURRENTLY OFFLINE BUT WORKING ON IT
# Witcher-3 bot for more knowledge of the game.  
The bot will be updated with the Alchemy section in the future, but now only the Bestiary section is available.  
First run the !clist command for the command list, then have fun with it.  
If you notice some picture loading issue then wait a few and it will probably work. My Server is a low end laptop so he needs time.  

Here is the link where you can invite the bot:  https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=825353030475317248&permissions=117824&scope=bot
